# Simple QA React App

A simple React Native app built with Expo, designed for mobile development and testing.

## Overview

This app provides a simple interface with two main sections: a counter with increment/decrement functionality and a greeting form with text input.

## Features

- **Counter**: Increment, decrement, and reset functionality
- **Greeting**: Enter name and get a personalized greeting
- **Test IDs**: All interactive elements have `testID` attributes for testing

## App Structure

```
App.js                 # Main app component with UI
├── Counter Section    # Increment/decrement/reset buttons
└── Greeting Section   # Text input and greeting display
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
- Xcode (for iOS builds)
- Android Studio (for Android builds)

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Generate native projects:
```bash
yarn prebuild
```

## Running the App

```bash
# Start development server
yarn start

# Run on iOS simulator (automatically installs CocoaPods)
yarn ios

# Run on Android emulator
yarn android

# Run on web
yarn web
```

## Configuration

- **App Name**: Simple QA React App
- **Bundle ID**: `com.simpleqareactapp.app`
- **Package**: `com.simpleqareactapp.app`
- **Expo SDK**: 51.0.0

## Test IDs

The app includes `testID` attributes for testing:

### Counter Section
- `counter-section` - Main counter container
- `counter-text` - Count display text
- `increment-button` - Plus button
- `decrement-button` - Minus button
- `reset-button` - Reset button

### Greeting Section
- `greeting-section` - Main greeting container
- `name-input` - Text input field
- `greet-button` - Greet button
- `clear-button` - Clear button
- `greeting-text` - Greeting display text

## Testing

This app includes `testID` attributes on all interactive elements, making it suitable for automated testing with various mobile testing frameworks.

## Building the App

The `ios/` and `android/` folders are not included in this repository. You need to generate them locally:

```bash
# Generate native projects
yarn prebuild

# iOS Debug Build (automatically installs CocoaPods)
yarn ios

# Android Debug Build
yarn android
```

The built apps will be available at:
- iOS: `ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/SimpleQAReactApp.app`
- Android: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Running with Metro Bundler

For development, you need both the app built and Metro bundler running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Metro bundler
yarn start

# Terminal 2: Build and run the app (in another terminal)
yarn prebuild
yarn ios
```

The Metro bundler must be running for the app to load properly in the simulator.

**Note**: The `ios/` and `android/` folders are generated by `yarn prebuild` and are not committed to the repository. Each user needs to run `yarn prebuild` locally to generate the native projects.


## Development

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linting
yarn lint

# Fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix

# Type checking
yarn type-check
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Clean build
yarn prebuild:clean

# Build for iOS (automatically installs CocoaPods)
yarn ios

# Build for Android
yarn android
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Build issues**: Run `yarn prebuild --clean` to regenerate native projects
- **iOS issues**: Ensure Xcode and iOS Simulator are installed
- **Android issues**: Ensure Android SDK and emulator are set up
- **Metro bundler**: Make sure `yarn start` is running for development builds
- **TypeScript errors**: Run `yarn type-check` to identify type issues
- **Linting errors**: Run `yarn lint:fix` to automatically fix code style issues
